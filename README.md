# ai-song-contest-2021
The paper trail of ideas and code in support of our sumission to the 2021 AI Song Contest.

## Lyrics

### Using instrumental audio for training
The lyrics generator was built based on a sequence to sequence model, where a user can input a line "Nothing's gonna change my love for you", and the model will probably output the next line "You oughta know by now how much I love you". Thus, a whole set of song lyrics can be generated by iteratively inputing the previous output. Addition to that, to make the generated lyrics contextually fit with the audio tracks, the input side also requires the audio features to that line. See [here](https://github.com/mstrcyork/ai-song-contest-2021/blob/main/conversations/agenda_and_convo_20210422.md) for dataset construction.

### theselyricsdonotexist.com
This [lyrics generator](https://theselyricsdonotexist.com/) was used to provide a series of song lyrics around input themes following specific genre (country, metal, rock, pop, dance, rap) and mood (very happy to very sad) conventions. This website's output can be used in combination with AI generated melodies to curate a song. It is up to the musician/songwriter to pick and select lyrics that'd match melodies or vice versa. 

## Ideas for melodies, chord sequences, basslines, and drum tracks
Came from the MAIA Markov algorithm. The seeds used can be found [here](https://github.com/mstrcyork/ai-song-contest-2021/tree/main/algorithms/run_maia_markov) in the four scripts with "generate" in their name. To replicate a generated result, one can go to [MAIA Suggest 2021](https://maia-suggest-2021.glitch.me), select the appropriate "gospel/pop" model, enter the seed (case-sensitive), and hit play. One should get exactly the same output as if one were to run the generate script from command line with Node.js. The state transition matrices and initial distributions are available at https://maia-suggest-2021.glitch.me/src/stm_etc/.
