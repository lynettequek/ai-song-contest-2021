## Ideas for melodies, chord sequences, basslines, and drum tracks
Came from the MAIA Markov algorithm. The seeds used can be found [here](https://github.com/mstrcyork/ai-song-contest-2021/tree/main/algorithms/run_maia_markov) in the four scripts with "generate" in their name. To replicate a generated result, one can go to [MAIA Suggest 2021](https://maia-suggest-2021.glitch.me), select the appropriate "gospel/pop" model, enter the seed (case-sensitive), and hit play. One should get exactly the same output as if one were to run the generate script from command line with Node.js. The state transition matrices and initial distributions are available at https://maia-suggest-2021.glitch.me/src/stm_etc/.
