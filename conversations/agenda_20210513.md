* Jem's new vocal recording
* Use of Mark's sax materials in intro/outro
* Any other remarks for Liam in terms of changes prior to finalising?
  * From Tom: double bass bassline inaudible over car stereo (but not sure if we need to do anything about that); sax echos didn't come across apart from in headphones, but otherwise the mono and in-car experience of the song is good.
* Richie's vocal recording
* Debrief of filming day
* Performing/reproduction rights update
* Paperwork for AI Song Contest deadline, which is Tue for audio, forms, and images
