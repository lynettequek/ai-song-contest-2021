# Following up from last meeting

* Updates from Jem, Liam, Alex, and Lynette
  * Alex located hit songs from [Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional/gb/daily/latest) resulting 6464 unique songs, and also crawled paired lyrics in [LRC format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)) from [here](https://www.rentanadviser.com/en/subtitles/subtitles4songs.aspx) and corresponding YouTube music videos in audio format for around 2611 songs. The instrumental version of songs can be obtained by a source separation model, and for each song, we can get multiple ~4s clips of paird audio and lyrics by the timestamp provided by LRC files. With these data, the next step is to pre-traine a language model and fine-tune it with the paird lyrics and instrumental audio clips. Thus the desired function is to generate lyrics for the given audio.
* Expecting some early GAN output from Mark
* Expecting some new models from Tom

# Interest from One Tribe TV (for a 4-minute piece for BBC One's ONE Show)

* Discuss what was proposed by the production company
* If people feel comfortable having a film crew come and shadow some of this work in York
* Potentially be interviewed by an associated ONE Show presenter (although might just be Tom)
