# Plan for songwriting session

## Introduce ourselves (for Zoom rec purposes)
Say who you are, what your research/practice is about, and what you're bringing to the songwriting session today.

## Go through the AI starting materials, listen discuss

* Mark's sax stuff
* Jem's lyrics stuff. Tom also added some lyrics stuff using some keywords from One Tribe TV, just in case Jem's were on other topics, but I think with both songs we're aiming for upbeat, Eurovision-y feel.
* Tom's MAIA Markov stuff

## Try to draft two song ideas
One for AI Song Contest, and one for One Tribe TV, beginning with the same pool of AI starting materials.
