# Plan for songwriting session

## Introduce ourselves (for Zoom rec purposes)
Say who you are, what your research/practice is about, and what you're bringing to the songwriting session today.

## Go through the AI starting materials, listen discuss

## Try to draft two song ideas
One for AI Song Contest, and one for One Tribe TV, beginning with the same pool of AI starting materials.
