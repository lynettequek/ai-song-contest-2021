If I don't make it to next Thursday's meeting then I should at least have some early WaveGAN outputs by then. I was thinking I'd try a couple of alternative approaches too in case they happen to be a better sonic fit.

Videos-wise, I've been using a GAN to generate GIFs, both using SinGAN's animation function (which generates smooth animation of a single image) and also by simply concatenating output images. SinGAN is really useful and practical for both tasks as it generates multiple outputs from a single image and can also perform super-resolution. The results are then rendered interactively (taking trigger messages via OSC from SuperCollider in response to audio inputs) using the Pyglet game engine, which is built on top of OpenGL.

Lynette obviously has more experience in the video domain than me but if you wanted me to try out this approach with some suggested images for the song contest vid then I'd be up for trying some ideas out.

Cheers,
