## Updates

- Team form submitted. We are officially called "The elephants and the".
- Anything of note on the AI Song Contest slack?


## Parameters of sax dataset

- G major
- 130 bpm? (Think +/-10 bpm time stretch post-generation wouldn't harm the sound quality too much...)


## Four-bar excerpts generation

- Tom to provide update.


## Video

- Tom quite liked the look of the Lucid Sonic Dreams link that Alex shared.
- Any other thoughts here?


## Overall sampling approach to sound world

- Where should this happen? In the DAW, in Tone.js? (E.g., [https://editor.p5js.org/tomthecollins/sketches/XdZujlTKJ(Badger synth))


## Structure

- Alex, shall we try a graph neural network for learning and generating structures? We could still have one definitive version of the song, but also have a structure re-generator on any website...


## Lyrics

- Alex to update us about the lyrics data gathering API he shared.
- Generally we discuss approaches to lyrics generation.
