# Liam/Jem and the sampling apporach

* Liam and Jem to explore plug-ins/existing equip to achieve this.
* Tom has explored repitching on Tone.js and bouncing the audio to file, so we can use this if desired.
* Mark will share some sax inputs for Jem and Liam 


# Alex

* Has been looking at some interesting stuff around lyrics, I think with some back and forth with Jem.
* Look forward to hearing about this.
* Would be great if we achieve a homegrown approach to lyrics this year, but no worries if we have to fall back on third party.

# Settings agreed for DAW

* 44.1 kHz, 24 bit
* Mark has 22.5 kHz, 16 bit but we thought that was OK.
